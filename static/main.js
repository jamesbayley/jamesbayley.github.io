// Since there are two copies of each icon in the footer 
// so that the correct icon can be rendered after the color
// theme is determined, sometimes the page can load before 
// the icons have been correctly positioned, resulting in 
// a flash on the page. To mitigate against this, the footer
// bar is hidden from view until the DOM is fully parsed.
