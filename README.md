# My Personal Headspace

## Welcome 👋🏻

This site is a deposit box for my thoughts, opinions and predictions on the future of technology, construction, engineering, education, etc. I make no guarantees as to the frequency of posts and updates to the content on the site; it is a personal hobby project and I will dedicate time to it, as and when I can. 

Nevertheless, I hope that others may find some useful ideas and inspiration within my writing and examples that may assist them in developing their skills. I am a strong proponent of the *lean web* and strive for simple solutions where feasible. Thus, the architecture of this site is basic (almost primitive), but it hopefully demonstrates what is possible with nothing but a solid understanding of basic HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.

I thank you for taking the time to peruse my work! Any suggestions or recommendations are welcome, but please be kind 😉
