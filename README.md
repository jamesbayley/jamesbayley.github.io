# My Personal Headspace

## Welcome üëãüèª

This site is a deposit box for my thoughts, opinions and predictions on the future of technology, construction, engineering, education, etc. I make no guarantees as to the frequency of posts and updates to the content on the site, it is a personal hobby project and I will dedicate time to it as and when I can. Nevertheless, I hope that others may find some useful titbits and ideas within my writing and examples, that may assist them in widening their own development skills: particularly in the front end and with regards to CSS and JavaScript. I am a strong proponent of the *lean web* and strive for simple solutions where feasible. Thus, the architecture of this website is basic (almost primitive), but I hope that it demonstrates what is possible with nothing a solid understanding of the basics of HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. Modern CSS has eliminated the requirement for JavaScript in the majority of situations related to UI development, and I strive to lean on HTML/CSS wherever possible in my implementation.
